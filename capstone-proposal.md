Michael Watkins
Meal Prep Planner

Purpose: To help people find tasty recipes to put into their meal prep calendar.

MVP features: Ability to access different recipes and put them into a daily planner.

Tools etc: C#/.Net, React and Javascript, MySQL, Spoontacular API, dotnet create react app scaffolding.

Stretch goals: An interactive Month Calendar that you can click on different days to see what you have planned for food.

Notes: I envision getting the majority of the MVP done before the capstone week and adding small pieces of functionality on as I work through it. Happy to try and think of more stuff to add once I get more familiar with how C# and react interact with one another.
